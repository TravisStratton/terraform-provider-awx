# awx_credential (Resource)

Manage an AWX credential. 
NOTE: The AWX API does not return encrypted secrets so changes made in AWX of the inputs field will be ignored. 
The only changes to the inputs field that will be sent are when the terraform code does not match the terraform state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awx_organization" "example" {
  name        = "tf_example"
  description = "example"
}

// Example machine credential

// Inputs options for machine credentials:
// username, password, ssh_key_data, ssh_public_key_data, become_method, become_password, ssh_key_unlock
// Setting a value to "ASK" is equal to choosing "Prompt at Launch"

data "awx_credential_type" "machine" {
  name = "Machine"
  kind = "ssh"
}

resource "awx_credential" "example-machine" {
  name            = "example_machine"
  organization    = awx_organization.example.id
  credential_type = data.awx_credential_type.machine.id
  inputs = jsonencode({
    "username" : "awx",
    "password" : "test1234", // insecure, example only
    "become_method" : "sudo",
    "become_password" : "ASK" // ASK = Prompt at Launch checkbox
  })
}

// Example source control credential

// Inputs options for source control credentials:
// username, password, ssh_key_data, ssh_key_unlock
// Setting a value to "ASK" is equal to choosing "Prompt at Launch"

data "awx_credential_type" "source-control" {
  name = "Source Control"
  kind = "scm"
}

resource "awx_credential" "example-source-control" {
  name            = "example_machine"
  organization    = awx_organization.example.id
  credential_type = data.awx_credential_type.source-control.id
  inputs = jsonencode({
    "username" : "awx",
    "ssh_key_data" : file("${path.module}/id_rsa") // insecure, example only
    "ssh_key_unlock" : "test1234"                  // insecure, example only
  })
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `credential_type` (Number) ID of the credential type.
- `inputs` (String, Sensitive) Credential inputs.
- `name` (String) Credential name.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Credential description.
- `organization` (Number) ID of organization which owns this credential. One and only one of `organization`, `team`, or `user` must be set.
- `team` (Number) ID of team which owns this credential. One and only one of `organization`, `team`, or `user` must be set.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Credential ID.
- `kind` (String) Credential kind.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The inputs field contains values that are not returned by the AWX API and thus not available in state.
# The first plan/apply after import will result in a modification to the inputs & kind so that the state can be updated.

terraform import awx_credential.example 5
```
