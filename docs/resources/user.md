## Schema

### Required

- `password` (String) User's password. If the password is updated in AWX, due to the AWX api, terraform will not know that it has been changed.
- `username` (String) The username of the user.

### Optional

- `email` (String) User's email.
- `first_name` (String) User's first name.
- `is_superuser` (Boolean) Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.
- `is_system_auditor` (Boolean) User is a system wide auditor.
- `last_name` (String) User's last name.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The password field contains values that are not returned by the AWX API and thus not available in state.
# The first plan/apply after import will result in a modification to the password so that the state can be updated.

terraform import awx_user.example 1
```
