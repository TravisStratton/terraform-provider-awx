# awx_workflow_job_template_job_node (Resource)

A node has its own ID, but must be associated to a workflow job template ID. And, the node must specify which actual job template this node will run, which is set using the attribute unified_job_template.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awx_workflow_job_template_job_node" "example_node" {
  all_parents_must_converge = false
  diff_mode                 = false
  identifier                = "0ddd9e82-e447-4ef2-9c96-20932fef4456"
  extra_data = jsonencode({
    current_version = "101"
    update_zipfile  = "example.zip"
    variable1       = 1
  })
  inventory                = 100
  job_tags                 = null
  job_type                 = null
  limit                    = null
  scm_branch               = null
  skip_tags                = null
  unified_job_template     = 1001
  verbosity                = null
  workflow_job_template_id = 1002
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `unified_job_template` (Number) This is the ID of the actual job template that should be executed as this node.
- `workflow_job_template_id` (Number) This is the ID of the workflow job template to which this node is embedded.

### Optional

- `all_parents_must_converge` (Boolean) Defaults to false.
- `diff_mode` (Boolean)
- `extra_data` (String) JSON Key/value pairs, wrap in jsonencode().
- `identifier` (String) The unique identifier for this node, set automatically by API when creating a new one.
- `inventory` (Number) This attribute is set to optional. However, creating new nodes may not work without providing this value. This provider was set up marking this optional so that you can import existing nodes from your AWX tower environment that were created without specficying inventory. Something that doesn't appear allowed on more current versions of AWX.
- `job_tags` (String)
- `job_type` (String)
- `limit` (String)
- `scm_branch` (String)
- `skip_tags` (String)
- `verbosity` (Number)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique ID for this node

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import awx_workflow_job_template_job_node.example_node 201
```
