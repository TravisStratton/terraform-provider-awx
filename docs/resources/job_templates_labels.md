  The /api/v2/job_templates/{id}/labels/ returns all label objects associated to the template. But, when asked to associate a label or

  principle. Instead, the terraform schema stores a list of associated labels. And, when creating or deleting or updated, it will make one api call PER
  list element. This allows the import function to work by only needing to pass in one job template ID to fill out the entire resource. If this was not done this way
  then when someone tries to to use the terraform plan -generate-config-out=./file.tf functionality it will create the resource block correctly. Otherwise, the
